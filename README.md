# module9b-profile

## What's This?
This is a custom React profile card I built for my CS81 class at SMC. I used Vite to set it up, styled everything with inline CSS, and created a theme around my alter ego â€” DJ Baptiste Williams. The layoutâ€™s clean, but I added personality with a mic battle background, bullets that hit ðŸ’£, and plans for hover sound effects.

## What I Used
- React + Vite for the frontend
- Functional components with props
- Inline styling to keep it flexible
- Custom assets (mic background, DJ avatar)

## What I Learned
I got better at breaking layouts into reusable components and using props to pass dynamic info. Figuring out how to load images properly in Vite took some trial and error, but now I know what to watch for. Git definitely threw me a few curveballs, but I handled conflicts and learned how to rebase and push properly.

## Challenges
Git conflicts â€” mainly with the README. Had to learn how to edit and resolve merge issues. Also ran into image path bugs early on but got it sorted.
